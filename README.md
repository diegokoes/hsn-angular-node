# HSN Angular + Express + MongoDB

> Unlike my [React HSN project](https://github.com/diegokoes/hsn-react-node), I'm doing this from the start all in english, I had enough of a headache mixing messages to the user in spanish, variables in english, data from the database given by my teacher in spanish... Just everything in english and it will be easier to code and to read.
